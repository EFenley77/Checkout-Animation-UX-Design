# Checkout-Animation

## Overview
This project was to create the UX/UI for a checkout experience using at least one form of animation. I decided to use AI to create my own skis and have the checkout experience be from a ski company.

## Learnings
Through this process, I was able to practice my skills by adding animation to my UX designs. I was able to learn enough about Adobe After Effects to create the animations in there in conjunction with Figma. I still wish I had more experience and skill within Adobe After Effects to take my basic animations to another level. Moving forward I am looking to continue exploring with After Effects and other animating software to be able to create more meaningful animations for my UX designs. 

## Tool Used
Adobe After Effects
Figma
Midjourney
